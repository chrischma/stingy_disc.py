# stingy_disc.py

## About
<code> stingy_disc.py</code> is a commandline tool that adds a new search option to the discogs search.

it helps you to find the cheapest price for the record you are searching for. the regular search engine of discogs only allows you to sort the results by price, while this price does not include shipping. as shipping prices can be ridiculously high some time, it is very helpful to have a list sorted by the **total price**. and this is what stingy_disc.py does. 

## Usage
run <code> python3 stingy_disc.py </code>. Enter any artist, album, single, ep and so on.
